# Lowdefy Blog Example

This example focuses on building a rich UI for a hypothetical personal blog.

It provides a interface where posts can be viewed and searched.

The main purpose of this example is to show what types of apps can be built with Lowdefy, how to construct rich UIs, and how the search can be used.

This example is deployed using [Netlify](https://docs.lowdefy.com/deployment).
